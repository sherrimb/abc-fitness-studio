    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>ABC Fitness Studio is a local wellness hub offering a variety of group classes including yoga, Pilates, and
      Zumba—designed to support both physical health and mental well-being. Our mission is to provide a welcoming,
      supportive space where individuals of all fitness levels can thrive.

      Rooted in values of balance, harmony, and active living, we’re more than just a place to work out—we’re a
      community. Alongside our classes, we also provide a curated selection of high-quality fitness equipment to help
      you continue your journey beyond the studio.

      As we grow, we’re excited to launch a new website to extend our reach, simplify class bookings, and make it easier
      for our community to explore our offerings. Whether you’re just getting started or looking to level up your
      routine, ABC Fitness Studio is here to help you move forward—body and mind..</p>
